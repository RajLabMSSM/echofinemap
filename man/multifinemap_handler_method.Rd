\arguments{
\item{dat}{Fine-mapping results data.}

\item{locus_dir}{Locus-specific directory to store results in.}

\item{fullSS_path}{Path to the full summary statistics file (GWAS or QTL)
that you want to fine-map.
It is usually best to provide the absolute path rather
than the relative path.}

\item{finemap_args}{A named nested list containing additional arguments 
for each fine-mapping method. e.g.
\code{finemap_args = list(FINEMAP=list(), PAINTOR=list(method=""))}}

\item{dataset_type}{The kind dataset you're fine-mapping
(e.g. GWAS, eQTL, tQTL).
This will also be used when creating the subdirectory where your results
will be stored
(e.g. \emph{Data/<dataset_type>/Kunkle_2019}).}

\item{force_new_finemap}{By default, if an fine-mapping results file for
 a given locus is already present,
then \pkg{echolocatoR} will just use the preexisting file.
Set \code{force_new_finemap=T} to override this and re-run fine-mapping.}

\item{LD_matrix}{Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) matrix to use for fine-mapping.}

\item{n_causal}{The maximum number of potential causal SNPs per locus.
This parameter is used somewhat differently by different fine-mapping tools.
See tool-specific functions for details.}

\item{conditioned_snps}{Which SNPs to conditions on when fine-mapping
with (e.g. \emph{COJO}).}

\item{compute_n}{How to compute per-SNP sample size (new column "N").\cr
If the column "N" is already present in \code{dat}, this column 
will be used to extract per-SNP sample sizes
and the argument \code{compute_n} will be ignored.\cr
If the column "N" is \emph{not} present in \code{dat}, one of the following 
options can be supplied to \code{compute_n}: 
\itemize{
\item{\code{0}: }{N will not be computed.}
\item{\code{>0}: }{If any number >0 is provided,
that value will be set as N for every row.
**Note**: Computing N this way is incorrect and should be avoided
if at all possible.}
\item{\code{"sum"}: }{N will be computed as:
cases (N_CAS) + controls (N_CON), so long as both columns are present}.
\item{\code{"ldsc"}: }{N will be computed as effective sample size:
Neff =(N_CAS+N_CON)*(N_CAS/(N_CAS+N_CON)) / mean((N_CAS/(N_CAS+N_CON))(N_CAS+N_CON)==max(N_CAS+N_CON))}.
\item{\code{"giant"}: }{N will be computed as effective sample size:
Neff = 2 / (1/N_CAS + 1/N_CON)}.
\item{\code{"metal"}: }{N will be computed as effective sample size:
Neff = 4 / (1/N_CAS + 1/N_CON)}.
}}

\item{credset_thresh}{The minimum mean Posterior Probability
(across all fine-mapping methods used) of SNPs to be included in 
the "mean.CS" column.}

\item{case_control}{Whether the summary statistics come from a case-control
study (e.g. a GWAS of having Alzheimer's Disease or not) (\code{TRUE})
or a quantitative study (e.g. a GWAS of height, or an eQTL) (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{priors_col}{[Optional] Name of the a column in 
\code{dat} to extract SNP-wise prior probabilities from.}

\item{seed}{Set the random seed for reproducible results.}

\item{verbose}{Print messages.}

\item{nThread}{Number of threads to parallelise across (when applicable).}

\item{conda_env}{Conda environment to use.}
