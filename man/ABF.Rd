\usage{
ABF(
  dat,
  credset_thresh = 0.95,
  compute_n = "ldsc",
  sdY = NULL,
  case_control = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Fine-mapping results data.}

\item{credset_thresh}{The minimum mean Posterior Probability
(across all fine-mapping methods used) of SNPs to be included in 
the "mean.CS" column.}

\item{compute_n}{How to compute per-SNP sample size (new column "N").\cr
If the column "N" is already present in \code{dat}, this column 
will be used to extract per-SNP sample sizes
and the argument \code{compute_n} will be ignored.\cr
If the column "N" is \emph{not} present in \code{dat}, one of the following 
options can be supplied to \code{compute_n}: 
\itemize{
\item{\code{0}: }{N will not be computed.}
\item{\code{>0}: }{If any number >0 is provided,
that value will be set as N for every row.
**Note**: Computing N this way is incorrect and should be avoided
if at all possible.}
\item{\code{"sum"}: }{N will be computed as:
cases (N_CAS) + controls (N_CON), so long as both columns are present}.
\item{\code{"ldsc"}: }{N will be computed as effective sample size:
Neff =(N_CAS+N_CON)*(N_CAS/(N_CAS+N_CON)) / mean((N_CAS/(N_CAS+N_CON))(N_CAS+N_CON)==max(N_CAS+N_CON))}.
\item{\code{"giant"}: }{N will be computed as effective sample size:
Neff = 2 / (1/N_CAS + 1/N_CON)}.
\item{\code{"metal"}: }{N will be computed as effective sample size:
Neff = 4 / (1/N_CAS + 1/N_CON)}.
}}

\item{sdY}{Standard deviation of quantitative trait.}

\item{case_control}{Whether the summary statistics come from a case-control
study (e.g. a GWAS of having Alzheimer's Disease or not) (\code{TRUE})
or a quantitative study (e.g. a GWAS of height, or an eQTL) (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{verbose}{Print messages.}
