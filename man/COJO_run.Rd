\usage{
COJO_run(
  gcta_path,
  bfile,
  cojo_slct = TRUE,
  cojo_cond = TRUE,
  cojo_joint = FALSE,
  conditioned_snps = NULL,
  prefix = "cojo",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{bfile}{Input PLINK binary PED files, e.g. test.fam, 
test.bim and test.bed (see PLINK user manual for details).}

\item{cojo_slct}{Perform a stepwise model selection procedure to select 
independently associated SNPs. Results will be saved in a 
*.jma file with additional file *.jma.ldr showing the LD 
correlations between the SNPs.}

\item{cojo_cond}{Perform association analysis of the included
SNPs conditional on the given list of SNPs. 
Results will be saved in a *.cma. The conditional SNP effects 
(i.e. bC) will be labelled as "NA" if the
 multivariate correlation between the SNP in question and
  all the covariate SNPs is > 0.9.}

\item{cojo_joint}{Fit all the included SNPs to estimate their joint effects 
without model selection. Results will be saved in a
 *.jma file with additional file *.jma.ldr showing the 
 LD correlations between the SNPs.}

\item{cojo_file}{Input the summary-level statistics 
from a meta-analysis GWAS (or a single GWAS).}

\item{exclude}{Specify a list of SNPs to be excluded from the analysis.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=COJO_args]{COJO_args}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{out}}{Specify output root filename.}
    \item{\code{maf}}{Exclude SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) 
less than a specified value, e.g. 0.01.}
    \item{\code{max_maf}}{Include SNPs with MAF less than a specified value, e.g. 0.1.}
    \item{\code{cojo_top_SNPs}}{Perform a stepwise model selection procedure 
to select a fixed number of independently associated SNPs without 
a p-value threshold. The output format is the same as that 
from \code{--cojo-slct}.}
    \item{\code{cojo_p}}{Threshold p-value to declare a genome-wide significant hit.
The default value is 5e-8 if not specified. 
This option is only valid in conjunction with the option \code{--cojo-slct}.
Note: it will be extremely time-consuming if you set 
a very low significance level, e.g. 5e-3.}
    \item{\code{cojo_wind}}{Specify a distance d (in Kb unit).
It is assumed that SNPs more than d Kb away from each other are in 
complete linkage equilibrium. The default value is 10000 Kb (i.e. 10 Mb) 
if not specified.}
    \item{\code{cojo_collinear}}{During the model selection procedure, 
the program will check the collinearity between the SNPs that
 have already been selected and a SNP to be tested. 
 The testing SNP will not be selected if its multiple regression R2 
 on the selected SNPs is greater than the cutoff value. 
 By default, the cutoff value is 0.9 if not specified.}
    \item{\code{diff_freq}}{To check the difference in allele frequency of 
each SNP between the GWAS summary datasets and the LD reference sample. 
SNPs with allele frequency differences greater than the specified 
threshold value will be excluded from the analysis. The default value is 0.2.}
    \item{\code{cojo_gc}}{If this option is specified, p-values will be adjusted 
by the genomic control method. By default, the genomic 
inflation factor will be calculated from the summary-level statistics 
of all the SNPs unless you specify a value, e.g. \code{--cojo-gc 1.05}.}
